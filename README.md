Programmer: Luigi Sanchez

Description: The program is an currency converter between pairs of currencies. i.e., USD as US Dollar to CAD as Canadian Dollar. 
             The application supports euro, US dollar, Candian dollar, Japanese yen, and Korean won as currencies.
             The application utilizes multiple views that switches between main view to favorites view using swipe gesture.

             The application allows currencies to be added or removed from the main view to be used in the conversion of currency.
             And finaly the data loaded from the favorites.txt where user favorites is stored is kept persistent for the life of the 
             program using the singleton pattern.
